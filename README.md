# imagePickTestApp
Test app used UIImagePickerController and PHAsset.

I had never tried to access to photo library for some reason, so I built a test app with it.

- Pick an image from photo library and display it on screen using UIImagePickerController
- Get the image geo location and display it on screen using PHAsset
